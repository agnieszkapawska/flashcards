# Flashcards
Application helps memorize new words, phrases or definitions. 
User adds new word with definition. During learning depending on 
correctness of memorized definition word is passed to the next category.
Move your word from "learning" through "refreshing" into "repeating". 
Stay focus because when you are mistaken the word would pass into "learning" again.  
This method helps you remember once and for all even the most difficult vocabulary.
